  Your launch lead. Builds a dated, step-by-step launch plan: a cheap real-world
  test first (a waitlist, a pre-sale or a pop-up with a real price, so real buyers
  confirm what the simulated panel said), then the countdown to opening day with
  owners and deadlines, the launch-day run sheet, and the first 30 days of what to
  measure and what to change. Use when the user says "how do I launch", "launch
  plan", "when can I open", "launch checklist", "go live", or "soft open".

# founder-launch

## Where this runs

The text after this skill's slash command in the message that invoked it is the argument. If `$ARGUMENTS` was replaced with that text, use the replacement. If the message is only the command, the argument is blank and the rules already in this skill apply.

This skill's folder is the directory of this `SKILL.md`. Run Python with `python` on Windows, and with `python3` when that is the command on PATH. If `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is expanded, it is the same folder.

Write `founder/` at the root of the open project. Never write it inside the installed skill folder.

Launching is a project with a date. This skill turns everything else in the pack
into a dated plan, and starts with the cheapest way to find out if real people
will pay before the big money goes out.

## Step 1: test before you spend

Pick the cheapest real test that fits the business, and run it before signing the
big costs in `founder/numbers.json`:

| business | the test |
| --- | --- |
| physical shop or café | a pop-up, a market stall or a pre-order list with a price and a date |
| online product | a landing page with the price and a "pre-order" or "join the waitlist" button |
| service or agency | three paid pilot clients at the planned price |
| subscription | a founding-member offer, paid up front |

Write the success line before running it (for example: 50 pre-orders in two weeks
at $6.50), and compare the result with the panel's buy rate. If real buyers fall
well short of the panel, trust the real buyers and go back to `/founder-offer` or
`/founder-pricing`.

## Step 2: the countdown

From today to launch day, with real dates (ask for the target date; default to the
earliest realistic one given lead times in `founder/ops.md`). Weekly blocks, each
task with an owner and a deadline:

- Legal and money: registration, bank account, permits from `founder/ops.md`.
- Build: fit-out or website, suppliers ordered by their lead times.
- Brand: sign, packaging, profiles from `founder/brand.md`.
- Marketing: the calendar in `founder/marketing.md` from launch minus 14 days.
- Team: hiring and training on the SOPs.
- A soft open or friends-and-family day before the public launch.

Mark the critical path: the tasks that move the launch date if they slip.

## Step 3: launch day

An hour-by-hour run sheet: who is where, what goes out on which channel, the
opening offer, what to do if something breaks (from the risk register).

## Step 4: the first 30 days

The weekly numbers to track (from the CFO: units a day against break-even; from
marketing: the channel numbers), the level that triggers a change, and a review on
days 7, 14 and 30 with the questions to answer.

## Output

`founder/launch.md` with the test, the countdown, the run sheet and the 30-day
review. Next: `/founder-plan` compiles everything into the business plan.
